# monid-connectors

The open connector definitions for [Monid](https://monid.ai) — the platform that
gives AI agents metered, pay-per-use access to hundreds of external APIs.

This repo defines Monid's **endpoints**: each connector is authored in
TypeScript (zod schemas + a few small functions), compiled into inert JSON docs,
and executed by a small generic engine — the same artifact runs locally with
your own API key, in tests via recorded fixtures, and inside the hosted
platform.

## Examples

Run an endpoint (JIT-compiles, cached):

```bash
deno task engine:run 'exa#search' --body '{"query":"solid-state batteries","numResults":3}'
# requires EXA_API_KEY in the environment

deno task engine:run 'akta#news' --query-params '{"query":"warehouse automation","limit":5}'
# requires AKTA_API_KEY
```

Browse the compiled catalog:

```bash
deno task catalog providers                  # what exists
deno task catalog endpoints --provider exa   # …under one provider
deno task catalog endpoints --category web-search
deno task catalog inspect 'exa#search'       # one endpoint's full contract
```

Verify everything:

```bash
deno task check && deno task test            # types + replay tests (zero network)
```
