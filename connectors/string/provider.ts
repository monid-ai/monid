 * String — web search and page fetching for agents, past each target's
 * anti-bot protection. JSON-over-HTTP against
 * `https://request.usestring.ai/v1` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
 * (portal.usestring.ai/docs/get-started/authentication).
 *
 * This cut ports `/search` and `/fetch` (see the PR description for why
 * `/sitemap` and the rest of the surface are left for a later PR).
 * Sourced entirely from String's own public docs, not third-party
 * reverse engineering — String is durable-alpha's own product, so the docs
 * are authoritative here rather than something to verify live against a
 * key the repo's author didn't have in hand while drafting this.
 *
 * Priced at the Growth-tier rate — $1.00/1,000 searches, $0.20-$4.00/1,000
 * fetches by billed class — per portal.usestring.ai/docs/get-started/
 * pricing (retrieved 2026-09-22); see each endpoint file for the per-unit
 * breakdown.
