/**
 * `POST /v1/fetch` — fetch any URL as clean, LLM-ready content, choosing
 * the fetch strategy (plain request vs. full browser) and proxy class
 * (standard vs. premium residential) automatically per target.
 *
 * BILLING, from String's own published docs (pricing.mdx "Usage — per
 * 1,000 requests" and api-reference/overview.mdx "Billed request type",
 * read 2026-09-22): the rate is one of four flat per-request lines,
 * named by the RESPONSE header `x-billed-request-type` —
 * `request_standard` / `request_premium` / `browser_standard` /
 * `browser_premium`. This is OUTPUT-determined, not input-gated: the
 * request can force the browser path (`executeJS`, `requireWSS`,
 * `screenshot`, `actions`) but the proxy class (standard vs. premium) is
 * always the target site's own anti-bot posture, invisible beforehand.
 * Quoted at the Growth-tier rate throughout, matching the search
 * endpoint's own pricing decision.
 *
 * WHY LIFECYCLE, NOT DECLARATIVE: `x-billed-request-type` is a response
 * HEADER, and this DSL's declarative path drops headers before
 * `usage.evidence` ever runs — `engine/transport.ts`'s `sniffDecode`
 * takes only `response.body`, and `usage.evidence`'s envelope
 * (`zEnvelopeData`) carries `output` (the decoded body) but no headers
 * field; confirmed by reading both, not assumed. `lifecycle.start` DOES
 * see response headers (`utils.request()` returns `{status, headers,
 * body}`), so this endpoint uses a single-tick lifecycle (no `poll` —
 * `/fetch` is a synchronous vendor call, no job id — the non-polling
 * COMPLETED branch) and stashes the header on `state.data`, the
 * documented billing-signal channel (`data.lifecycle.state.data`) for
 * `usage.evidence` to read.
 *
 * ESTIMATE: the browser-vs-request axis is knowable from the request
 * (`executeJS`/`requireWSS`/`screenshot`/`actions` force browser); the
 * proxy-class axis is not, so this promises the cheaper (standard) proxy
 * on whichever strategy the request implies — an honest floor, not a
 * worst case, for an output-determined quantity.
 *
 * SETTLE: reads `x-billed-request-type` off `state.data` (stashed by
 * `lifecycle.start`). A transport that does not surface response headers
 * (the DSL's own documented fallback, `TransportResponse.headers` being
 * optional) settles zero rather than guessing which of the four lines
 * fired.
