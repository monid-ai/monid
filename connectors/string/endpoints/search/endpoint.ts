/**
 * `POST /v1/search` — search Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave, or Mojeek past
 * each engine's own anti-bot protection.
 *
 * BILLING, from String's own published docs (not third-party reverse
 * engineering — get-started/pricing and api-reference/search on
 * portal.usestring.ai/docs, read 2026-09-22): every search is billed as
 * one "browser standard rate" request. Without `searchCount`, one request
 * is always exactly one billed page. WITH `searchCount`, only the
 * `google` engine is paged: the API keeps fetching further Google results
 * pages (up to 10) until `searchCount` organic results are collected or
 * the time budget runs out, and "each page that answered is billed as one
 * search." `duckduckgo`, `brave`, and `mojeek` accept `searchCount` but
 * ignore it — always exactly one billed page.
 *
 * ESTIMATE: without `searchCount`, always 1 page. With it, on `google`
 * (the default when `engine` is omitted): String's docs describe "about
 * eight to ten organic results" per page with a hard 10-page cap, so the
 * estimate ceilings on the conservative low end —
 * `min(10, ceil(searchCount / 8))`. A page that returns fewer than 8
 * results in practice would need more pages than this promises; there is
 * no published per-page floor to promise against exactly. Any non-google
 * engine always estimates 1, since searchCount is a no-op there.
 *
 * SETTLE: reads `paging.pages` from the response when present (String
 * only sends it when `searchCount` was in the request); otherwise 1.
 *
 * PRICING: String's rate is plan-tier USD ($1.50/1,000 on Starter, $1.00/
 * 1,000 on Growth — pricing.mdx "Search"), not a vendor "credits"
 * abstraction, and the response carries no billing receipt to read at
 * settle time the way Firecrawl's or Exa's does. Quoted here at the
 * Growth-tier rate ($0.001/page) — a deliberate choice, not a guess.
