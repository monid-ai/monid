/**
 * transcribe.so — speech-to-text for public media URLs (YouTube, podcast
 * platforms, direct audio/video links) with speaker labels, timestamps,
 * chapters and subtitles. JSON-over-HTTP against
 * `https://transcribe.so/api/v1` with bearer-token auth (`presets.auth.bearer`).
 *
 * SHARED KEY. The connector runs every monid user's job under ONE
 * transcribe.so account (the vendor key monid holds), so every
 * transcription it creates belongs to that one account. NEVER add an
 * endpoint that takes a transcription id: every monid user would read
 * every other user's transcript. The id lives only in lifecycle state
 * (`externalRunId`), is never returned in the output, and the poll
 * strips it — and the dashboard deep-links that carry it — out of the
 * chapters before they ride the payload.
 *
 * ONE endpoint (`transcribe-so#transcriptions`), one lifecycle, authored
 * HERE (kling's posture — the whole run protocol is a provider fact):
 *   - start: `POST /transcriptions` with the FLAT wire body assembled from
 *     the validated input (`source` derived from the URL's host), under a
 *     run-stable `Idempotency-Key` so a host-side retry of the start tick
 *     cannot create a second paid job. A 409 (the same key's first request
 *     is still in flight upstream), a 429 or a 5xx on the create is THROWN
 *     (retriable — the key makes the retry converge on the ONE job); any
 *     other non-2xx is DATA (COMPLETED with the vendor's status and
 *     envelope, zero-billed): a 402 `insufficient_funds` /
 *     `spend_cap_exceeded` / `max_charge_exceeded` reaches the caller
 *     verbatim.
 *   - poll: `GET /transcriptions/{id}/wait?timeout=25&include=chapters`
 *     — the vendor's own long-poll (25 s < requestMs 35 s). `_timed_out`
 *     or an in-flight status parks the run; `completed` fans out the
 *     artifact reads (`Promise.all`: transcript markdown always, SRT/VTT
 *     only when `formats` asks) and assembles the output; `failed` /
 *     `cancelled` / `quoted` settle as OUR synthesized 502 with a FIXED
 *     `{error: {code, message}}` — the vendor's internal error text is
 *     never copied (it can name the id or infrastructure).
 *   - no stop: transcribe.so exposes no cancel for a started job.
 *
 * BILLING: the pool is US dollars (pay-as-you-go retail, $1 per audio
 * hour = $0.016667 per billed minute, whole minutes). The endpoint's
 * `estimate` holds the caller's own `max_charge_usd` ceiling expressed
 * in minutes; `evidence` settles `ceil(duration_seconds / 60)` off the
 * completed row, and the engine's fold (minutes × the pinned rate) IS the
 * bill. There is deliberately NO `usage.consolidate`: the completed row
 * does carry `charge_usd`, but it is the same minutes × rate rounded to
 * four decimals (0.0333 for 2 minutes vs the fold's 0.033334), and
 * claiming it would raise `usage.mismatch.derived` — monid's rate-drift
 * alarm — on EVERY run for a rounding hair. `charge_usd` is not returned
 * in the output either; the receipt is the fold.
