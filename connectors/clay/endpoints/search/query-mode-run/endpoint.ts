 *
 * PUBLIC identity is pinned brace-free (`zEndpointPath` admits no
 * placeholders, design D9): `/search/query-mode/run`, the v1 id verbatim.
 * v1 carried `search_id` in the BODY and mapped it onto the path inside a
 * lifecycle hook; here it is a first-class validated `pathParams` slot
 * (fundable's `/deal` precedent) — the engine substitutes and URI-encodes
 * it, and the doc's compiled url shows where the field goes.
