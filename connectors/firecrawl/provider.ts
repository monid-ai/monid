/**
 * Firecrawl — web data for agents. JSON-over-HTTP against
 * `https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; three
 * endpoints answer synchronously (`/scrape`, `/map`, `/search`) and three run
 * as durable jobs (`/crawl`, `/batch/scrape`, `/agent`).
 *
 * Two settle fns live HERE and every endpoint inherits them (leaf-wise
 * fallback); the async lifecycle deliberately does NOT — a provider-level
 * `lifecycle.start` would be inherited by the synchronous endpoints and
 * replace their declarative execution, so the job protocol is authored on the
 * three async endpoints (identical sources intern to one fnTable entry each).
 *
 * Verified live 2026-09-16 against a real key:
 *   `/scrape`                -> data.metadata.creditsUsed  (1 plain, 5 + json)
 *   `/search`                -> creditsUsed                (top level, 2 @ limit 2)
 *   `/crawl` `/batch/scrape` -> creditsUsed                (top level of the status body)
 *   `/agent`                 -> creditsUsed                (top level of the status body)
 *   `/map`                   -> no meter at all            ({success, id, links})
 *
 * BILLING LINES NOT MODELED, and why (the D29 completeness rule asks for the
 * exclusions to be written down, because an unmodeled input-gated line makes
 * estimates silently wrong the moment a caller uses that input):
 *   - Threat-protection scan at the ACCOUNT level (+2 credits per URL) —
 *     a server-side team policy with no request field. The per-request
 *     `threatProtection.mode: "normal"` override IS modeled, since that one
 *     is input-gated.
 *   - FIRE-1 agent steps inside `actions` — usage-based, no published
 *     formula.
 *   - `lockdown` on a cache MISS bills 1 rather than 5; the estimate holds
 *     the hit ceiling and the vendor's claim settles the difference.
 *   - `x_routing` on `/search` is modeled but never ESTIMATED: which hosts a
 *     query returns is the search's answer, not its question.
 *   - `threatProtection` on `/map`: the endpoint is flat-rated and the scan
 *     basis for a call that fetches no pages is unpublished.
 *   - `threat_protection_scan` on `/search` counts DELIVERED results, which is
 *     an approximation the vendor does not confirm: Firecrawl publishes
 *     "+2 credits per URL scanned" without saying whether it scans before or
 *     after trimming to `limit`, nor whether it de-duplicates repeated URLs.
 *     No per-line scan figure is reported either (the response carries one
 *     aggregate `creditsUsed`), so there is nothing truer to read. Documented
 *     rather than guessed at: inventing a de-duplication rule the vendor has
 *     not specified would be the same mistake in the other direction, and the
 *     vendor's aggregate claim settles the run regardless.
 * Firecrawl exposes no machine-readable pricing surface, so there is no drift
 * suite for it — these pinned rates are guarded by `deno task test:live` plus
 * the per-run `usage.mismatch.derived` signal, which cross-checks every
 * modeled line against the vendor's own meter on EVERY run.
