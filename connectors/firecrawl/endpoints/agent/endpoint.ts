/**
 * `POST /v2/agent` — autonomous multi-page research into structured JSON.
 *
 * Same job protocol as `/crawl` and `/batch/scrape` (submit -> poll -> cancel,
 * the status URL being the submit URL plus the id), so the lifecycle fns here
 * are BYTE-IDENTICAL to theirs and intern to one shared fnTable entry per
 * phase. The agent's terminal body carries `data` as a single OBJECT rather
 * than an array and is never paginated, which the shared poll already handles:
 * a non-array `data` short-circuits the `next` walk and returns the envelope
 * untouched.
 *
 * BILLING: this is the one endpoint Firecrawl prices DYNAMICALLY — it
 * publishes no formula, only the `maxCredits` ceiling the caller sets and the
 * `creditsUsed` the run reports. So the model meters in CREDIT units at 1
 * credit each: the estimate promises the ceiling the vendor itself enforces,
 * and the settle reports what was actually drawn. Derived and claimed agree by
 * construction here — which is the honest reading of a vendor that publishes
 * no rate, rather than inventing one to disagree with.
 *
 * `maxCredits` is REQUIRED at the binding: the vendor's own default is a
 * silent 2,500, and an estimate has to promise a bounded number before the run
 * holds credit.
