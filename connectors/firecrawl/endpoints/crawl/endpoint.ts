/**
 * `POST /v2/crawl` — walk a site and return clean content for every page.
 *
 * ASYNC (design D10/D21): submit returns a job id, the job is polled to a
 * terminal status, and the results ride the status body. The three Firecrawl
 * job endpoints share ONE protocol —
 *   `POST {path}`        -> {success, id, url}
 *   `GET  {path}/{id}`   -> {status, total, completed, creditsUsed, data, next?}
 *   `DELETE {path}/{id}` -> cancel
 * — and the status URL is just the submit URL plus the id, so `/crawl`,
 * `/batch/scrape` and `/agent` author BYTE-IDENTICAL lifecycle fns that
 * normalization and content-addressing intern to one fnTable entry per phase.
 * They live on the endpoints rather than the provider because a provider-level
 * `start` would be inherited by the synchronous endpoints and replace their
 * declarative execution.
 *
 * `next` is PASSED THROUGH, not followed. The poll returns the vendor envelope
 * as it arrived — the first chunk of `data`, `next` intact — rather than
 * stitching the chain into one output: a 10,000-page crawl would otherwise
 * become a single unbounded payload, and the vendor's own paging would vanish
 * from the caller's view. But `next` is an authenticated Firecrawl URL the
 * caller cannot fetch, so a cursor alone would be a dead end; the poll
 * therefore merges the job `id` into the envelope and the connector exposes
 * the vendor's OWN reader as a first-class endpoint — `firecrawl#crawl/{id}`,
 * which pages with `skip`/`limit` and is FREE, because reading a job draws no
 * credits.
 *
 * BILLING: 1 credit per page crawled, plus the same per-page modifier stack
 * `/scrape` carries — applied to EVERY page, which is what makes a `json`
 * format on a 1000-page crawl a 5000-credit run rather than a 1000-credit one.
 * `limit` is REQUIRED at the binding: the vendor's own default is 10,000
 * pages, and an estimate has to promise a bounded number before the run holds
 * credit.

         *  processed, authoritative even when the result set was paginated or
         *  truncated. `pdf_page` sums the parsed page counts the documents
         *  actually carry.
         *
         *  SCOPE is deliberately mixed, and worth stating: `page` and the flag
         *  lines derive from `completed` (the WHOLE job), while `x_routing`
         *  and `pdf_page` are counted off the rows in `$.data` — which is the
         *  FIRST CHUNK only when the envelope carries `next`. A chunked crawl
         *  whose later chunks hold x.com URLs or multi-page PDFs therefore
         *  derives less than the vendor claims and reports a
         *  `usage.mismatch.derived`. That is EXPECTED. Billing is unaffected:
         *  `creditsUsed` is the vendor's claim and the claim is what bills
         *  (D27). Scaling the observed count up by `completed / delivered`
         *  would invent a number for rows never seen, and D27 is explicit
         *  that unobserved entries are omitted rather than guessed — a true
         *  lower bound reads better on a receipt than a plausible fiction. */
