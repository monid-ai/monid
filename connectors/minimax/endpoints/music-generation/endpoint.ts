/**
 * MiniMax Music — `POST /v1/music_generation`, one blocking call.
 *
 * Flat per-song billing, so the model is a LEAF PER_CALL and BOTH
 * quantities fns are compiler-synthesized (`{counts: {}}` is the only
 * lawful return for a meterless model). The engine appends the flat 1
 * under the reserved `CALL` key on any 2xx — which is precisely why the
 * provider's `lifecycle.start` must synthesize a 502 for MiniMax's
 * HTTP-200 envelope errors: without it, an auth or balance failure would
 * bill $0.15.
 *
 * Identity falls out of `request.path` — no `endpoint` pin needed, since
 * `zEndpointPath` admits `_` (design D1).
