 * MiniMax Image — `POST /v1/image_generation`, one blocking call.

 * Plain per-result metering: a LEAF PER_UNIT doc at the published
 * $0.0035 per generated image, independent of mode and model.
 *
 * The estimate holds the requested `n`; the settle counts what actually
 * came back. That difference is the content-safety rule in one line —
 * MiniMax omits blocked images from the response array, so they are never
 * charged, and no special case is needed to express it.
