/**
 * MiniMax Text-to-Speech — `POST /v1/t2a_v2`, one blocking call.
 *
 * MODEL-DEPENDENT RATE AS A COMPOSITE (design D5): MiniMax prices T2A by
 * tier — $100/M characters for the `*-hd` models, $60/M for `*-turbo`. A
 * LEAF PER_UNIT carries exactly one rate, so the doc declares BOTH lines
 * and the fns route the character count to whichever the selected `model`
 * names. That is the D19 rule: selection is a COUNTING rule owned by the
 * fns, never a model shape. The unselected line carries no count at all —
 * it is absent from evidence, not zero.
 *
 * RATES ARE PER CHARACTER, not per million. `every` is a BLOCK rate — the
 * fold is `ceil(quantity / every) × amount` — so `$100` with
 * `every: 1_000_000` would round a 500-character run up to a whole block
 * and bill $100 for it. $0.0001 and $0.00006 with `every: 1` are the same
 * card, correctly folded.
