/**
 * Keenable (keenable.ai) — web search and page fetch for AI agents.
 * Two synchronous REST endpoints against `https://api.keenable.ai/v1`,
 * auth `X-API-Key`.
 *
 * The catalog surface is the authenticated pair (`POST /v1/search`,
 * `GET /v1/fetch`). The keyless `/public` twins exist to evaluate the
 * API without an account (shared per-IP pool, `X-Keenable-Title`, no
 * credits) and are not exposed — design D1.
 *
 * Billing: Keenable meters authenticated usage in credits, 100,000
 * requests/month free, and publishes that search and fetch each cost
 * one (credits docs, 2026-09-16). REST responses carry no usage
 * receipt — MCP reports `_meta["keenable/usage"]`, which this HTTP
 * connector never sees — so there is no `usage.consolidate` and the
 * derived fold settles (design D2; same posture as pdl). One pool
 * `default`, PER_CALL 1 on the provider, inherited by both docs.
