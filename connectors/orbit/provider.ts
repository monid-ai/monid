/**
 * Orbit (orbitsearch.com) — the deepest available context about a PERSON.
 * JSON over HTTP against `https://api.orbitsearch.com`, bearer auth with an
 * `sk_orb_` key, one public version: v3.
 *
 * Two shapes live behind that one host:
 *
 *   - A SYNC read — the profile read. One request, one answer.
 *   - ASYNC WORK — search and enrich. The submit answers `202` with a
 *     snapshot carrying the id and `status: "running"`; the lifecycle polls
 *     the matching status route until the status is terminal, so ONE monid
 *     run returns finished work. Orbit's status routes are not catalog
 *     endpoints: the engine drives every poll inside the run.
 *
 * EVERY SUBMIT CARRIES `Idempotency-Key: {runId}:submit` — the host-stable
 * run id (design D34), so a retried or replayed start converges on the
 * search or enrichment the first attempt created instead of paying for a
 * second one. Orbit documents the header and answers `409` when a key is
 * reused with a different body; the run id changes only when the run does.
 *
 * THE LIFECYCLE IS NOT ON THE PROVIDER. A provider-level `start` replaces
 * declarative execution on the SYNC endpoint too. Each async endpoint
 * authors its own phases.
 *
 * SCOPES: `search:read` and `profile:read`, the same pair Orbit's own hosted
 * MCP server publishes. The connector reaches no surface that needs
 * `watchers:write` or `webhooks:write`, so the provider key never has to
 * carry them.
 *
 * ONE STATUS-READ RULE, the same retry class in all three lifecycles —
 * Orbit's error guide puts `429` and every temporary server failure in a
 * single retry class, so a status read answering `408`, `429` or ANY `5xx`
 * is a lookup that failed rather than work that ended. Each one holds the
 * run open. That matters more here than politeness: the search or build is
 * still running on Orbit's side and still drawing credits, so settling on a
 * failed lookup abandons work the account is charged for. `Retry-After`
 * arrives in SECONDS on Orbit's `429`s and the v3 contract asks callers to
 * honor it, so it sets the next tick's cadence — clamped to [1s, 120s] so a
 * malformed header cannot stall a run, and bounded by `runMs` regardless.
 * Without the header a single run backs off fifteen seconds and the batch
 * thirty, its poll cadence being the slower of the two.
 * The lifecycles also FOLLOW THE LINK Orbit hands back (`links.status`),
 * which is what the v3 guide tells every caller to poll, and fall back to
 * the documented path shape.
 *
 * BILLING — THE RECEIPT SETTLES EVERY RUN. Every v3 response carries Orbit's
 * own receipt for the operation:
 *
 *   "billing": { "id", "pricingVersion", "reservedCredits",
 *                "consumedCredits", "releasedCredits", "heldCredits",
 *                "status": "open" | "settled" }
 *
 * `status` goes `open` -> `settled`, and `consumedCredits` on the terminal
 * snapshot is what Orbit charged (verified live 2026-09-20, 46 credits of
 * receipts). So every billed endpoint here is metered in Orbit's OWN credits
 * and the receipt is the evidence — provider-level `usage.evidence` reads it,
 * provider-level `usage.consolidate` claims it and plucks it out of the
 * payload (a receipt, not data).
 *
 * The receipt is the EVIDENCE, not only the claim, for a reason the engine
 * makes binding: a zero claim is pruned and falls back to the derived fold.
 * Orbit's zero receipts are real answers — an enrich of a profile already at
 * depth settles 0 — so a fold derived from anything else would overrule them.
 *
 * Nothing about the charge is inferable from the snapshot's visible state,
 * which is why nothing here tries:
 *   - a row seen `enriching` is not always a charged build (12 index hits
 *     with one row enriching settled 2, not 2 + 5);
 *   - a build can finish between two ticks and never be seen mid-build;
 *   - an enrich of a profile already at depth can answer `202 running` with
 *     `reservedCredits: 0` and settle 0 a few seconds later, so a 202 says
 *     nothing about whether work was charged.
 *
 * RATES appear in one place only: `usage.estimate`, the pre-run ceiling, read
 * from the published card (`GET /v2/developer/pricing`, unauthenticated,
 * version `2026-09-17`): index_search 1 per 10 results, candidate_discovery 1
 * per profile, partial_profile 5, full_profile 10, profile_read 1. A rate
 * change on Orbit's side moves the settle with it; only the ceiling is pinned.
 *
 * SURFACES NOT IN THIS CONNECTOR, and why:
 *   - Watchers: `watcher_run` and `watcher_update` accrue on Orbit's schedule
 *     AFTER the create call returns, so no run can settle them.
 *   - Population search: the receipt it reserves is settled "as the work
 *     completes", long after a pass-through submit returns.
 *   - Bulk search: held for an internal review on the vendor's side.
 *   - Webhooks: the create response carries a plaintext signing secret.
 *   - `face_search`, `profile_query` and the company lines price routes the
 *     public v3 document does not carry.
