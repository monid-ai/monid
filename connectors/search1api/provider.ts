/**
 * Search1API (s1.dev) — live web data for agents: web search, news, page
 * crawling, sitemap discovery, and trending topics over
 * `https://api.search1api.com` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
 *
 * Rate card (https://s1.dev/pricing, verified 2026-09-17): every endpoint
 * here costs 1 Search1API credit per call — except `/search` and `/news`
 * with `crawl_results > 0` ("Deep Search"), which add 1 credit per
 * successfully crawled page; the endpoints model that as COMPOSITE.
 * Responses carry no usage meter, so there is no `consolidate` — the
 * derived fold is the bill.
 *
 * `/search`, `/news` and `/crawl` also accept a BATCH array body (one
 * credit per item); the connector mirrors the single-object form only —
 * batching is the same verb repeated.
 *
 * Vendor non-2xx is DATA: errors arrive as `{detail}` or an RFC-9457
 * problem body (`{title, detail, status}` — 402 x402 payment challenges
 * included), which `output.fromError` normalizes here.
