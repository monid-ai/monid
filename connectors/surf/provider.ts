/**
 * Surf (asksurf.ai) — crypto intelligence for agents: 105 endpoints over
 * `https://api.asksurf.ai/gateway/v1`, Bearer auth. 104 are synchronous
 * relays (101 GET, three JSON POSTs in the on-chain SQL family); the one
 * durable SQL job (`/onchain/sql/jobs`) owns its own start / poll / stop
 * lifecycle at the endpoint (design D3).
 *
 * BILLING IS THE PUBLISHED TIER, NOT THE RESPONSE FIELD (design D1). Surf
 * prices every call at Light 1 / Standard 2 / Heavy 4 credits (the tier
 * table by family: https://docs.asksurf.ai/pricing, checked 2026-09-16;
 * the per-endpoint tier is v1's — the 2026-08-03/04 balance drills
 * confirmed the 13 endpoints they measured, and the nine docs carrying a
 * "(partial)" note keep v1's undrilled BEST READING of the vendor's
 * unnamed tier entry), and each endpoint's flat PER_CALL line pins its
 * tier. Every 2xx
 * body also carries `meta.credits_used` — v1 measured it against the
 * account balance in 2026-08 (13 endpoints, both directions wrong:
 * `web/fetch` reports 2 and is charged 1, `heatscore/projects` reports 1
 * and is charged 4, `onchain/sql` reports 5 which is not a tier) — so it is
 * NOT a vendor claim: no
 * `usage.consolidate`, the derived fold IS the bill, and the tests hold the
 * 105 tiers as literals (clay D7a). The field stays in the body, relayed
 * verbatim, with a provider note saying what it is not; v1 stripped it.
 *
 * Hooks here are the two provider-wide facts: bearer auth, and the error
 * digest over Surf's `{ error: { code, message } }` envelope (no `meta` on
 * errors, so nothing billing-related ever rides an error body).
 *
 * Timeouts mirror services/workflows/endpointExecution/config.yml (surf):
 * 60 s request / 60 s run; the SQL family's two docs override their own.
