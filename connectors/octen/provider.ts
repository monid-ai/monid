/**
 * Octen (octen.ai) — real-time web access. PORT SCOPE: only the four
 * endpoints v1 had ENABLED (search, broad-search, extract, embedding). The
 * other seven were deliberately disabled there ($0 token-pricing
 * placeholders, invite-only betas, or an inadmissible rate matrix) — porting
 * them would expose the exact free compute v1 disabled them to avoid; they
 * arrive with the pricing pass, as their own change.
 *
 * Usage is NATIVE per endpoint (calls / sub-queries / URLs / tokens read
 * from the response's `meta.usage` receipt), so each endpoint carries its
 * own settle fn — no provider-level usage.
