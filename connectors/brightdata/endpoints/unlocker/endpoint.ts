/**
 * Bright Data Web Unlocker API — any public URL, fetched past whatever is
 * in the way.
 *
 * Shares `POST /request` with `brightdata#serp`, so the id is declared
 * (see the serp twin). `auth.inject` merges `unlockerZone` instead of
 * `serpZone`; that field IS the product switch (design D1).
 *
 * FLAT PER-REQUEST BILLING (design D6): $1.50 per 1,000 requests
 * pay-as-you-go, $0.0015 a call. Page weight does not enter the bill —
 * Web Unlocker API is priced per request, not per gigabyte, so a heavy
 * page and a small one settle identically and there is no metered line.
 * `render: "true"` buys a browser at no extra charge on this card.
