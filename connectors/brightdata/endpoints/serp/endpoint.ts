/**
 * Bright Data SERP API — a search engine results page, parsed.
 *
 * Shares the `POST /request` wire path with `brightdata#unlocker`, so the
 * id is DECLARED rather than derived: omitting `endpoint` would collide the
 * two on `brightdata#request` (AGENT.md; the contactout twin posture).
 *
 * `auth.inject` is spelled inline because neither preset fits — the bearer
 * preset reads `data.params.apiKey` and stops there, and this endpoint must
 * also merge the SERP zone into the body at egress (design D1). The
 * unlocker twin's inject is the same shape over `unlockerZone`, so the two
 * sources differ and intern to two fnTable entries; that is the honest
 * outcome, since the zone field they read is the whole difference between
 * the two products.
 *
 * FLAT PER-REQUEST BILLING (design D6): Bright Data prices SERP API at
 * $1.50 per 1,000 requests pay-as-you-go — $0.0015 a call, whatever the
 * page returns. Result count does not enter the bill, so there is no
 * metered line and no quantities fn to author: the compiler synthesizes the
 * one lawful empty counts fn for a flat model and the engine appends the
 * flat 1 under `CALL`.
