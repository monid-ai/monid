/**
 * The `POST /request` body, mirrored from Bright Data's published OpenAPI
 * (`PostBody`) — the fields BOTH products share. SERP API and Web Unlocker
 * API are one wire path with two zone types, so the common mirror lives
 * here and each endpoint extends it with the fields its own product
 * documents (design D2).
 *
 * `zone` is REQUIRED by the vendor and deliberately ABSENT from the mirror:
 * it names a resource inside the key-holder's account, so it is credential
 * material that `auth.inject` supplies at egress, never a caller argument
 * (design D1). It is the connector's one documented divergence from the
 * published body — the exa posture, where a field the caller must not send
 * simply is not in the schema.
 *
 * Optionality only, no `.default()` (D25): Bright Data documents a default
 * for `method` (`GET`) but the wire accepts the body without it, so the
 * default stays the vendor's to apply.
