/**
 * Anymail Finder (anymailfinder.com) - B2B work-email finding and
 * verification. Four endpoints against `https://api.anymailfinder.com/v5.1`,
 * the API key raw in `Authorization` (no scheme prefix), billed in Anymail
 * Finder credits (one pool for finds and verifications - v5.1
 * `GET /account` `credits_left`).
 *
 * Every address a find returns was SMTP-verified live before the
 * response, catch-all domains included. Billing (anymailfinder.com/pricing
 * and the per-endpoint API docs, 2026-10-02; vendor-verified live): a
 * person find costs 1 credit and a decision-maker find 2, only when
 * `email_status` is `valid`; a company find costs 1 for the whole list,
 * only when verified addresses come back; a verification costs 0.2
 * whatever the verdict. A miss is a 200 with `email_status: "not_found"`
 * (never a 404) and is free. An exact repeat of a find or verification
 * within 30 days is free upstream.
 *
 * Every billable response carries `credits_charged` - the vendor's own
 * meter for that call - so the provider declares ONE consolidate that
 * reads it as the claim and strips it from the output (design D27); each
 * endpoint states its own evidence. A 30-day repeat reports
 * `credits_charged: 0`; the engine prunes that zero claim, so every
 * endpoint's evidence also counts zero on an explicit zero meter (the
 * ahrefs pattern) and the derived fold settles free too.
