/**
 * Akta (akta.pro, by Wokelo) — company intelligence. Every endpoint is a
 * synchronous GET against `https://api.akta.pro/api/v1/...`, so both hooks
 * live HERE and every endpoint inherits them (leaf-wise fallback):
 *
 *   - `input.toRequest`: Akta renders ARRAY query params as ONE
 *     comma-separated value (per its docs) — the engine sends only scalar
 *     query values, so this generic hook joins every array leaf before the
 *     wire. Closed term: Object/Array are lint-whitelisted pure globals.
 *   - `usage.consolidate`: Akta's NATIVE meter is CREDITS ($1 = 20
 *     credits, per docs.akta.pro/getting-started/pricing) and every
 *     response reports its own draw in `credits_consumed` — the vendor's
 *     claim, lifted out of the payload in one motion (design D27).
 *   - `usage.evidence`: the generic quantities default — endpoints
 *     override only when their counting diverges (subclassing, D27).
