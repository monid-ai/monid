/**
 * POST /v1/people/search under the WORK key — filtered search over 300M+
 * profiles, with optional work-email / phone reveal. The personal-email
 * twin is `people-search-personal-email`.
 *
 * Billing (drill-verified 2026-08-24): one search credit per profile
 * RETURNED (page_size=1 → 1 credit; zero results → nothing);
 * `reveal_info=true` adds one email credit of the key's kind and one phone
 * credit per profile where that data was found. Live responses key
 * `profiles` by profile URL (an object) while the docs show an array — the
 * counting reads both (v1 `searchProfileCounts`).
