/**
 * GET /v1/email/enrich under the WORK key — the person behind an email
 * address, with the work address and phone. The personal-email twin is
 * `email-enrich-personal-email`.
 *
 * A miss answers 404 (error-as-data, zero-billed by the engine). A hit
 * follows the enrich either/or (design D3): email and/or phone credits
 * when contacts came back, one search credit when a profile came back
 * without any. This endpoint speaks the camelCase SCALAR dialect — the
 * key's address rides the plain `email` string, `workEmail` is null under
 * the work key (drill 2026-09-01) — which the counting reads alongside
 * the array dialect.
