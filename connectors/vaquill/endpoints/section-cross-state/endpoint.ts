/**
 * `GET /us/statutes/section/{act_id}/cross-state`: the same provision
 * elsewhere.
 *
 * ANSWERED-OR-REFUNDED billing, which is why this is metered rather than
 * flat. Measured live 2026-09-17: a section with five equivalents billed 6,
 * the same 6 as one with three, so the price does not scale with states.
 * But a section with NO equivalents returned 200 and billed 0.
 *
 * A flat `PER_CALL` cannot express that second half. A zero claim prunes to
 * an empty claim, an empty claim falls back to the derived fold, and a flat
 * fold would then bill the full 6 for a call the vendor refunded. So the
 * billable quantity is "an answer delivered", counted 1 or 0, which is a COUNTING
 * rule owned by the fns, never a model shape (design D19).
