/**
 * Vaquill: US primary law as an API.
 *
 * Every endpoint is a synchronous call against
 * `https://api.vaquill.ai/api/v1/...` with a `vq_key_` bearer token, so the
 * whole connector is the exa shape (sync POST + body) with the akta shape
 * (sync GET + queryParams) alongside it. Nothing here needs a lifecycle.
 *
 * RATE CARD: the pinned `consumes.amount`s across this connector are the
 * published per-endpoint credit prices from
 * https://api.vaquill.ai/api/v1/api-credits/pricing, read 2026-09-17. That
 * endpoint is the machine-readable card and is free and unauthenticated, so
 * a repricing is checkable without a key.
 *
 * ONE pool, and the vendor reports its own draw on every response, so the
 * provider owns both halves of the settle: `credits` declares the pool,
 * `consolidate` lifts `creditsConsumed` out of the payload as the claim.
