# Proposal: add-connector-string

## Why

String is durable-alpha's own web-access API: search past each engine's
anti-bot protection and fetch any URL as clean, LLM-ready content, with
automatic proxy rotation, CAPTCHA solving and JavaScript rendering. Two JSON
endpoints on one host, one bearer key, no new engine capability — search
settles a flat per-page rate, fetch settles one of four output-determined
rates read off a response header. Listing it here reaches every
Monid-integrated agent.

## What Changes

- **connectors/string** — 2 endpoints against
  `https://request.usestring.ai/v1`, bearer auth.
  - `POST /search`: `PER_UNIT`·`PAGE`, Growth-tier rate ($0.001/page).
    Without `searchCount`, always 1 page. With it, only the `google` engine
    pages further results (up to 10) to collect enough; `duckduckgo`,
    `brave` and `mojeek` accept but ignore `searchCount`. Evidence reads
    `paging.pages` when present, else 1.
  - `POST /fetch`: `COMPOSITE` of four `PER_UNIT`·`RESULT` components
    (`request_standard`, `request_premium`, `browser_standard`,
    `browser_premium`), each the Growth-tier rate for that class
    ($0.0002–$0.004). The billed class is OUTPUT-determined — named by the
    response header `x-billed-request-type`, not knowable from the request
    alone (the proxy-class axis is always the target site's own anti-bot
    posture). `jsonSchema` extraction is not exposed: its surcharge scales
    with page/schema size with no published flat rate.
- **A response header reaches `usage.evidence` via lifecycle state, not the
  declarative path.** The declarative `usage.evidence` envelope carries
  `input`/`output`/`lifecycle.state` — no response headers. `fetch` uses a
  single-tick `lifecycle.start` (no `poll`: `/fetch` is synchronous, no job
  id) that reads `x-billed-request-type` off the raw response and stashes it
  on `state.data.billedRequestType`, the documented billing-signal channel
  for a settled value read off `lifecycle?.state.data`. `evidence` reads
  that stashed value and settles the one matching component; a transport
  that doesn't surface response headers settles zero rather than guessing.
- **`shared/testing/fixtures.ts`** — `RECORDED_RES_HEADERS` gains
  `x-billed-request-type`, the one addition needed for a fixture to
  record/replay the header `fetch`'s billing depends on. Allowlisted, not a
  credential, no other connector's behavior changes.
- Fixtures are synthetic (`synthetic-` prefix), built from String's own
  published example responses — no API key was available while drafting.

## Capabilities

- `string-connector`.

## Non-goals

- `sitemap` and the rest of String's surface (a separate hosted MCP tool
  set beyond `search`/`fetch`) — a later change, not bundled here.
- Pricing String's plan tiers as separate credit pools. String bills in
  plan-tier USD with no vendor "credits" abstraction and no settle-time
  cost receipt on the response, so both endpoints quote the Growth tier as
  a fixed rate rather than modeling tier selection.
- `jsonSchema` structured-extraction pricing on `fetch` — no published flat
  rate to model; left unexposed rather than guessed.

## Impact

New connector tree; no new `Unit`, preset, or hook, and no compiler or
schema change — `ENGINE_VERSION` and `config.yml`'s `doc_format_since` are
untouched. One test-infra change: `RECORDED_RES_HEADERS` widens by one
entry.
