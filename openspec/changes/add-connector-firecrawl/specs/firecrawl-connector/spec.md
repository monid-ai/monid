# firecrawl-connector (delta)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Firecrawl provider definition with the shared vendor meter
The firecrawl provider SHALL declare name `firecrawl`, `request.baseUrl`
`https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2`, auth `presets.auth.bearer()`, timeouts 300 s
request / 310 s run — matching the vendor's own per-page `timeout` ceiling of
300 s so that a caller-set `timeout` is never cut short by our transport —
credit pool `default` ("Firecrawl credits"), a
provider-level `usage.consolidate` that reads the vendor's own `creditsUsed`
claim — plucking the bare top-level field out of the output and falling back
to `data.metadata.creditsUsed` — and a provider-level `output.fromError` that
normalizes `{success, error, code?}` into `{message, code?, raw}`. The
provider SHALL NOT declare a lifecycle.

#### Scenario: Claim wins and agrees
- **WHEN** `POST /scrape` returns a document whose
  `data.metadata.creditsUsed` is 1
- **THEN** usage is `{credits: {default: 1}, evidence: {page: 1}}` with no
  `mismatch`, and the nested meter stays in the output as page provenance

#### Scenario: Bare receipt is plucked away
- **WHEN** `POST /search` returns a top-level `creditsUsed: 2`
- **THEN** the claim is `{default: 2}` and `creditsUsed` is absent from the
  output

#### Scenario: Absent meter falls back to the fold
- **WHEN** `POST /map` returns `{success, id, links}` with no meter
- **THEN** the claim is omitted and the derived flat 1 settles the run

#### Scenario: Vendor non-2xx is zero-billed data
- **WHEN** any endpoint receives a 402 `{success: false, error}`
- **THEN** `isProviderError` is true, usage is
  `{credits: {}, evidence: {}}`, and the output is
  `{message, raw}`

### Requirement: Inputs mirror the published v2 OpenAPI without translation
Every `schema/inputs.ts` SHALL mirror its OpenAPI request schema with
optionality only — no `.default()`, no invented fields, no `.strict()` — and
no endpoint SHALL declare `input.toRequest`. Where the API accepts both a
bare-string and a `{type}` object spelling for an option-less union member —
`formats`, `sources` and `categories` — the mirror SHALL accept both, and
usage fns SHALL read the native shapes directly.

#### Scenario: No invented scalars
- **WHEN** the compiled `firecrawl#scrape` body schema is inspected
- **THEN** it carries `formats`, `parsers`, `redactPII` and `lockdown`, and
  carries no `json`, `jsonSchema` or `jsonPrompt` field

#### Scenario: The validated input is the wire body
- **WHEN** any firecrawl doc is inspected
- **THEN** `input.toRequest` is undefined

#### Scenario: Both vendor spellings validate
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#search` runs with `sources: ["web"]` or
  `sources: [{type: "web"}]`, or with `categories: ["research"]` or
  `categories: [{type: "research"}]`
- **THEN** each is accepted and priced identically

### Requirement: Primary limiting knobs are required at the binding
`firecrawl#search` SHALL require `limit`, `firecrawl#crawl` SHALL require
`limit`, and `firecrawl#agent` SHALL require `maxCredits`, each derived from
the faithful mirror at the endpoint def even though the vendor publishes a
default. `firecrawl#batch/scrape` SHALL leave `urls` untightened, and
`firecrawl#map` SHALL leave `limit` optional because it is flat-rated.

#### Scenario: Unbounded crawl is refused before the wire
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#crawl` runs without `limit`
- **THEN** the run fails INVALID_INPUT before any wire call

### Requirement: Every input-gated surcharge is a modeled billing line
`firecrawl#scrape`, `firecrawl#crawl` and `firecrawl#batch/scrape` SHALL price
a COMPOSITE whose components name each published per-page surcharge: `json`,
`question`, `highlights`, `audio`, `video`, `redact_pii`,
`prompt_injection_check` and `lockdown` at 4 credits; `zero_data_retention` at
1; `threat_protection_scan` at 2; `x_routing` at 29; `pdf_page` at 1; plus the
base page. `firecrawl#search` SHALL price `search_block` as PER_UNIT·RESULT
with `every: 10` at 2 credits, a `zdr_search` delta of 8, and the same page
stack per scraped result.

#### Scenario: JSON format quintuples a scrape
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#scrape` is estimated with
  `formats: [{type: "json"}]`
- **THEN** the estimate is 5 credits with evidence `{json: 1, page: 1}`

#### Scenario: X routing is 30, and 34 with extraction
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#scrape` is estimated for an `x.com` or `twitter.com`
  URL, with and without a `json` format
- **THEN** the estimates are 30 and 34 credits

#### Scenario: Search block rate rounds up
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#search` is estimated with `limit: 10` and `limit: 11`
- **THEN** the estimates are 2 and 4 credits

#### Scenario: `limit` is per source, so sources multiply the estimate
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#search` is estimated with `limit: 10` and three distinct
  `sources`
- **THEN** the estimate is 30 results and 6 credits, matching the vendor
- **AND** a repeated source entry does not multiply, because the response is
  keyed by source name and cannot carry a second array for it
- **AND** `categories` never multiply, because they filter the same result set

#### Scenario: PDF pages offset the base fee
- **WHEN** a scrape returns `metadata.numPages: 3`
- **THEN** evidence is `{pdf_page: 2, page: 1}` and the fold is 3 credits

#### Scenario: Batch counts X routing per URL
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#batch/scrape` is estimated with one `x.com` URL and one
  ordinary URL
- **THEN** the estimate is 31 credits, not 2 or 60

#### Scenario: X routing settles on delivered rows, not the request
- **WHEN** a batch is given an `x.com` URL and an ordinary URL but delivers
  only the ordinary one
- **THEN** evidence carries no `x_routing` line, because the Grok charge
  applies to pages Firecrawl actually fetched
- **AND** the estimate still counts it, because the request list is all a
  pre-run promise can read

#### Scenario: Output-determined lines are not guessed
- **WHEN** any endpoint is estimated
- **THEN** `pdf_page` is absent from the estimate, and `x_routing` is absent
  from a `firecrawl#search` estimate

### Requirement: One job lifecycle shared by the three async endpoints
`firecrawl#crawl`, `firecrawl#batch/scrape` and `firecrawl#agent` SHALL each
declare `lifecycle.start`/`poll`/`stop` whose sources are byte-identical, so
the compiler interns one fnTable entry per phase. `start` SHALL relay the
compiled request and park RUNNING on the returned `id`, returning a non-2xx as
COMPLETED data and throwing only when a 2xx carries no id. `poll` SHALL treat
`scraping`, `processing` and an absent status as RUNNING, `completed` as
COMPLETED 200, and any other status as COMPLETED with a synthesized
`httpStatus` 500 and `providerHttpStatus` 200. A status LOOKUP answering 408,
429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 — the set Firecrawl documents as retryable — SHALL
be treated as RUNNING with a backed-off `pollAfterMs` rather than as a
terminal run, because the job is still executing and still accruing charges
and a settled run cannot be resumed. `stop` SHALL DELETE the status URL
best-effort.

#### Scenario: A transient status lookup does not settle the run
- **WHEN** two consecutive status lookups answer 429 and 503 before the job
  reports `completed`
- **THEN** the run settles 200 on the completed body with the vendor's usage,
  and is never classified as a provider error

#### Scenario: One interned fn per phase
- **WHEN** the compiled bundle is inspected
- **THEN** the three endpoints' `lifecycle.start`, `poll` and `stop` `$fn`
  keys are pairwise equal, and the three sync endpoints carry no lifecycle

#### Scenario: In-body job failure is zero-billed
- **WHEN** a status body reports `status: "failed"` on HTTP 200
- **THEN** the result is `httpStatus` 500, `providerHttpStatus` 200, and usage
  is `{credits: {}, evidence: {}}`

#### Scenario: Settle on the vendor's page count
- **WHEN** a job completes with `completed: 2` and `creditsUsed: 2`
- **THEN** usage is `{credits: {default: 2}, evidence: {page: 2}}` with no
  mismatch

### Requirement: Chunked job results are handed back, and reachable
Firecrawl caps a response at 10 MB and chunks a large job's results, carrying
a `next` cursor. `lifecycle.poll` SHALL return the vendor's terminal envelope
as received — `next` intact, `data` unmodified — and SHALL NOT follow the
cursor: stitching chunks would put an unbounded payload through one run, and a
failure mid-walk would return a PARTIAL set as a success while the vendor's
`completed` count billed the whole job. The poll SHALL merge the job `id` into
the envelope, because the status body does not carry it and `next` requires a
credential the caller never holds.

The connector SHALL mirror the vendor's second operation so the remaining
chunks are reachable: `firecrawl#crawl/{id}` (`GET /crawl/{id}`) and
`firecrawl#batch/scrape/{id}` (`GET /batch/scrape/{id}`), each taking
`pathParams.id` and an optional `queryParams.skip`, each `FREE`, and each
overriding the provider's `usage.consolidate` to an empty claim — a job status
body repeats the WHOLE job's `creditsUsed` on every chunk, so inheriting it
would re-bill the entire job on every read. Both SHALL also override the
provider's timeouts down to 30 s request / 60 s run: the provider's 300 s
budget exists to honour a caller-set per-page `timeout` on a scrape, and a job
read takes no such field.

#### Scenario: A chunked result is returned as the vendor sent it
- **WHEN** a job completes with 2 rows and a `next` cursor
- **THEN** the output holds those 2 rows, carries `next` unchanged and the
  job `id`, and no further request is issued
- **AND** usage still settles on the vendor's whole-job claim

#### Scenario: Reading a job bills nothing
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#crawl/{id}` or `firecrawl#batch/scrape/{id}` reads a
  body reporting `creditsUsed: 3`
- **THEN** usage is `{credits: {}, evidence: {}}` and the meter remains in the
  output as the job's own provenance

#### Scenario: Agent object result is left alone
- **WHEN** `firecrawl#agent` completes with `data` as a single object
- **THEN** the output's `data` is that object, and usage is
  `{credits: {default: n}, evidence: {CREDIT: n}}` for the reported
  `creditsUsed`

### Requirement: Endpoint identities may carry a path placeholder
`zEndpointPath` and `zEndpointId` SHALL accept a `{param}` segment alongside
lowercase literal segments, so a resource-style endpoint is identified by the
vendor's actual path rather than an invented pin. The parameter name is part
of the identity. An earlier engine rejects such an id at load, so this is a
doc-format change: `schema.doc_format_since` moves to 0.3.0 and
`ENGINE_VERSION` to 0.3.0. Every doc floors at 0.3.0, including those
carrying no placeholder — `doc_format_since` is one declared fact, not a
per-doc inference (add-meta-notes D4).

#### Scenario: The identity is the vendor's path
- **WHEN** the compiled bundle is inspected
- **THEN** `firecrawl#crawl/{id}` and `firecrawl#batch/scrape/{id}` exist,
  each declaring `endpoint` explicitly and equal to its `request.path`
- **AND** the compiled url keeps `{id}` unencoded, so the engine can
  substitute it

#### Scenario: Malformed placeholders are still rejected
- **WHEN** an identity is `/crawl/{}`, `/crawl/{Id}` or `/crawl/{id`
- **THEN** it fails validation
