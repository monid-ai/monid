# Design: add-connector-ahrefs

Stack scope: PR #20 contains 21 endpoints and the shared provider; PR #21
adds the remaining 15. The 36-endpoint design and rate audit cover both
authored branches.

Only the choices the port was FORCED to make. Everything not listed follows
the precedents in `.claude/commands/provider-port.md` (sync GET → akta,
sync POST → exa).

## D1 — The vendor formula `max(50, units × rows)` as two lines; the minimum is charged

Ahrefs bills uncached, non-free requests in API units: `units_per_row × rows`, floored at
50 per request (empty results included). v1 billed the caller per ROW and
absorbed the 50-unit floor on the platform side (`billAtPublishedRate`,
"requests under ceil(10.375 / U) rows run at a loss by design" — the
break-even is 50 × $0.0006225 ÷ $0.003 = 10.375 units; an earlier revision
of this line misquoted it as 21.5, derived from a wrong $0.00129/unit cost).

A `max()` is not a model shape. Two options were live:

1. **Two PER_UNIT lines (chosen).** `rows` (unit RESULT, `amount` = the
   endpoint's units per row) and `minimum_top_up` (unit CREDIT, `amount`
   1). `evidence` puts `rows` on the first and `max(0, 50 − units × rows)`
   on the second, so the fold is exactly the vendor's charge, and the
   agent reads both facts off the card: "10 units per row" and "topped up
   to a 50-unit request minimum". Selection is a counting rule (D19).
2. One `rows` line and absorb the floor (v1 parity). Rejected: the doc is
   the vendor's rate card, not a pricing policy (clay D3 — mobile-phone's
   charged miss). Whether the caller pays the floor is the broker's call,
   made with the fact in hand; a doc that hides it settles less than the
   vendor took on every small request.

Consequence: a billable empty 2xx settles 50 units where v1 settled 0.
Cached/free responses settle zero under D2.

## D2 — Settle the actual consumption header, including explicit zero

The initial port deferred response headers and always derived the bill.
PR #20 re-review correctly identified that this would bill cache hits,
which the vendor serves without consuming units. The official rule at
https://docs.ahrefs.com/en/api/docs/limits-consumption names
`x-api-units-cost-total-actual` as actual consumption and `x-api-cache`
as `hit` / `miss` / `no_cache`. All 36 per-row constants (21 here, 15 in
PR #21) were separately re-derived from endpoint field descriptions on
2026-09-16; their source URLs and cost breakdowns live beside each rate.

A provider `lifecycle.start` performs the ordinary synchronous request and
relays status/body unchanged. It stores a valid nonnegative safe integer
from `x-api-units-cost-total-actual` in typed `state.data.actualUnits`.
If that header is absent or malformed and `x-api-cache` says `hit`, it
stores zero. A valid actual meter takes precedence over cache metadata.
Missing/malformed meter information with no cache hit remains absent:
settlement falls back to the published card, never an invented zero.

Provider `usage.consolidate` reports this value without changing output.
A positive claim overrides the fold and mismatches retain the derived
amount. The engine intentionally prunes zero claims before deciding
whether to fall back, so consolidate alone cannot settle a free response.
Every endpoint's shared evidence function therefore returns zero billable
rows and zero minimum top-up when `actualUnits` is explicitly zero. Both
paths then agree on zero, without changing engine-wide claim semantics.
Estimates still reserve the uncached amount because cache status is not
known before the request. Errors remain zero usage through the engine.

The fixture recorder allowlist now retains these two non-sensitive
response headers. New synthetic replay cases test paid/zero claims,
cache-only responses, malformed or missing meters, mismatches, and
non-2xx responses. These are documented-header simulations, not live
header recordings; direct recording with an Ahrefs key remains task 3.4.

## D3 — One generic rows counter, stated on every endpoint

Every doc has TWO metered lines, so the compiler requires each doc to own
its `estimate` and `evidence` — a provider-level counter (akta's shape)
cannot be inherited. The counter is therefore stated VERBATIM on all 36
endpoints and interns to ONE fnTable entry: the first array value in the
body is the rows (`{ backlinks: [...] }`, `{ metrics: [...] }`), an object
body counts one row (`{ metrics: {...} }`, `{ domain_rating: {...} }`),
and the per-row rate is read off the doc's own model
(`data.usage.model.components.rows.consumes.amount`) — the same
model-driven posture as akta's provider evidence, so the constant lives in
one place per doc.

Estimates read the rate the same way and differ only in where the row
promise comes from: the required `limit` (18 docs), a fixed 1 (6 snapshots),
250 countries (metrics-by-country — deduced from the vendor, about 230
countries carry data), `keywords.length`, `top_positions`,
`targets.length`, or date buckets (D6). Eight shapes, each interned across
its family.

## D4 — Fixed field sets, and the guard that survives compilation

The vendor prices a row by the UNIQUE fields across `select` / `where` /
`order_by`. Each endpoint injects its fixed `select` in `input.toRequest`
(callers never supply it) and its units-per-row constant is the sum of
those fields' costs from the vendor OpenAPI annotations (v1's
`UNITS_PER_ROW`, drill-verified against `x-api-units-cost-row`).

v1 restricted `where` / `order_by` to that set with `.superRefine` — which
compiles to nothing. Both become JSON Schema `pattern`s:

- `order_by`: `^T(,T)*$` with `T = (f1|f2|…)(:(asc|desc))?` (one token
  only where the vendor parses a comma list as a single field name —
  crawled-pages; a narrower sortable set where the vendor 400s on a
  selectable field — `title_target`, `http_code_target`).
- `where` (a JSON filter string): must be a JSON object, and a negative
  lookahead rejects any `"field": "<name>"` whose name is outside the set
  — `^(?![\s\S]*"field"\s*:\s*"(?!(?:f1|f2)")[^"]*")\s*\{[\s\S]*\}\s*$`.
  Coarser than v1's tree walk (it does not parse JSON) but it fails
  closed on the one thing that matters: a field that would raise the
  per-row cost never reaches the wire.

Both are enforced by ajv before any spend, and the tests pin an
out-of-set field on each.

## D5 — Row budgets REQUIRED; scope knobs default

`limit` (1–100, the plan cap) and `top_positions` are the estimate's
whole basis, so they are REQUIRED at the binding (D25) — v1 defaulted them
to 100, which is also the vendor's cap; the vendor's own default is 1,000
rows, ten times the plan cap. `mode` (subdomains), `protocol` (both) and
`history_grouping` (monthly) carry the vendor's documented defaults at the
binding so the wire always states the scope, as v1's always-serialized
defaults did. Batch Analysis applies `mode` / `protocol` per target —
upstream 400s on a target without both.

## D6 — History buckets without a clock

History rows are date buckets between `date_from` and `date_to`. v1
defaulted `date_to` to today and clamped the hold at 60 buckets via a
`.superRefine`. Hook fns have no `Date` (not in the closed-term
whitelist) — so `date_to` is REQUIRED at every history binding, and the
estimate counts with pure arithmetic over the two YYYY-MM-DD strings.

What it counts (live-measured 2026-09-16 on the vendor's free targets,
Monid-dev runs; CodeRabbit on PR #20 flagged the first draft's
`ceil(days / 30)`): a row is a bucket ANCHOR inside the range —
daily rows carry every day (01-31→02-01 = 2 rows), weekly rows are dated
on Mondays (Sun 01-05→Mon 01-06 = 1 row, dated 01-06), monthly rows on
the 1st (01-31→02-01 = 1 row, dated 02-01). So the estimate counts the
anchors in `[date_from, date_to]`: days, Mondays (from a known Monday on
the days-from-civil scale), or 1sts (month index arithmetic). v1's
`ceil(days / 30)` under-held a 1st-to-1st span in a short month
(02-01→03-01 = 2 rows, ceil(29 / 30) = 1); the reviewer's "inclusive
calendar months" would over-hold 01-31→02-01 (2 vs 1). The settle trues
up to the rows returned either way.

The 60-bucket cap is not enforceable without a refine; it rides
`meta.notes`, and the estimate promises the whole range rather than
clamping — a clamp would under-hold.

## D7 — The vendor body relays verbatim; no `{type, rows}` envelope

v1 normalized every 2xx to `{ type: label, rows | data }` for its row
counter. v2 counts in `evidence` off the raw body (D3) and relays the
vendor's own shape — `{ backlinks: [...] }` — because that is what the
doc says the endpoint returns, and nothing billing-related rides the body
to strip. Hosted consumers expecting v1's envelope change shape; flagged.

## D8 — Synthetic fixtures, engine-issued URLs

No Ahrefs key is held. Bodies follow the v1 adaptor tests; each fixture's
URL was produced by running the doc through the engine with a stub fetch,
so `select` injection, the keyword join and the binding defaults are
recorded exactly as issued. Every file is `synthetic-` prefixed and says
so. Direct live tests are gated on `AHREFS_API_KEY` and may consume
API units; cache hits and free queries settle zero under D2.

## D9 — Provider error handling and the synchronous meter relay

Ahrefs errors are real non-2xx `{ error: string }` bodies (v1 drills) —
digested, raw kept. `request.headers: { Accept: application/json }`
mirrors v1. Timeouts 30 s / 60 s from `endpointExecution/config.yml`.
The provider-level synchronous relay and meter claim are described in D2;
there is no poll or stop hook. Categories `seo` / `geo` added to `categories.ts` with the manifest's
own names and descriptions; `ai-responses-count` alone is `geo`.
