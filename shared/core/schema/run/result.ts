 * Adopted from monid-services with async (design D12): the ours/theirs
 * status pair — as an OPTIONAL `providerHttpStatus` (stated only when a
 * lifecycle fn synthesized the billed status; v1 required it verbatim
 * everywhere). Deliberately NOT adopted: the `actualCost`-on-error channel
 * (usage is doc-settled; vendor error ⇒ zero usage is policy), the
 * `metadata` bag and `providerRunId` field (the lifecycle `state` IS the
 * handle — `state.externalRunId`), and `stop.unresolved` (stop is
 * best-effort void — result reporting arrives with the metered wave).
