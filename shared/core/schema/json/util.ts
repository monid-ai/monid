/**
 * JsonUtil — value-level JSON utilities, implemented by the ENGINE
 * (engine/json-util.ts) and handed to fns as `ctx.utils.json`.
 *
 * NOT fnTable content: if these lived in the table, every bundle would re-ship
 * the same standard library and version it per-bundle. They are part of the
 * fn ABI, versioned by ENGINE_VERSION (adding a method = engine minor bump).
 * Litmus: universal, connector-agnostic primitive → here; connector-shaping
 * behavior → fnTable (preset or ad-hoc fn).
 *
 * STRICTNESS CONTRACT — absence is opt-in, mismatch always throws:
 *   - LOOKUPS (`get`/`num`/`len`) THROW when the path is absent — a typo'd
 *     path must never silently bill zero. The `optional*` variants return
 *     `undefined` when absent, but STILL throw on a present value of the
 *     wrong type ("optional" = may be absent, never = may be garbage).
 *     Invalid path SYNTAX always throws (a bad path is a bug, not absence).
 *     Throws inside slot fns surface as FN_CONTRACT (fail-closed).
 *   - TRANSFORMERS (`omit`/`pick`/`merge`) stay shape-tolerant by design:
 *     omit walks whatever it finds; pick skips absent paths (best-effort
 *     receipts); merge replaces non-objects.
 *
 * Paths use the restricted RFC 9535 subset (json/path.ts).
 *
 * A TS interface, not a zod object — methods aren't structurally validatable
 * (the deliberate exception to zod-first).
