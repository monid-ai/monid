/**
 * HOOK usage.estimate — the PRE-RUN cost estimate (v1
 * `paymentLifecycle.estimate`): validated caller input → an estimated
 * `Usage` with the SAME `counts` keys `usage.consolidate` settles in (the
 * admission hold is priced from it by the host; settle trues it up
 * key-by-key). PURE + sync like the other non-lifecycle hooks — no IO, no
 * state, INPUT-only: the estimate is the settle's promise, made before
 * the vendor is touched (engine-executed via `estimate(runInput)`).
 *
 * Absent ⇒ the engine defaults to `{counts: {}}` — a flat doc needs no
 * estimate, the model + success is its whole story (design D18/D19).
 * Estimates are TYPED INLINE fns on their docs (design D23 — no estimate
 * presets): the body is `z.output` of the doc's own input schema and the
 * counts keys are the model's literal metered keys, so field typos and
 * foreign keys fail `deno task check`.
 *
 * `usage.model` mirrors the envelope ctx: the doc's own usage.model,
 * GROUPED under the section it comes from (`data.usage.model` — the ctx
 * path says the provenance), so a generic provider-seam fn can derive its
 * counts KEY (leaf → unit, composite → the sole metered component id)
 * without per-doc arguments.
