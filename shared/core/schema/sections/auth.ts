 * Auth section — SHARED by EndpointDef and ProviderDef (leaf-wise fallback);
 * the two halves of credential handling, grouped:
 *   - `inject`: the FUNCTION that puts the secret into the outgoing request
 *     (usually presets.auth.header("x-api-key")). Executed only by the
 *     injector (directTransport locally, hosted Relay), never the pipeline.
 *     Must RESOLVE endpoint ?? provider (compile error if neither).
 *   - `credentials`: the zod SHAPE of the secret material. Falls back
 *     endpoint ?? provider ?? DEFAULT ({ apiKey: non-empty string }) — which
 *     is why most providers (exa included) never declare it; only
 *     non-standard shapes (user+password, multiple keys) do. Compiled to
 *     JSON Schema in the doc; the injector validates RESOLVED secrets
 *     against it (→ MISSING_CREDENTIAL) before running inject.
 *
 * No secret VALUE ever appears in a def, doc, bundle, or this repo — only
 * the shape travels; values come from env (local) or Broker/KMS (hosted).
