/**
 * ENDPOINT↔RESOURCE BINDINGS (design D32, reshaped by
 * refine-resource-model D43) — ONE optional `resources:` block on the
 * endpoint def, PURPOSE-KEYED: the key names the relationship (v1's
 * interaction vocabulary, pluralized), the value is ALWAYS an array —
 * an endpoint may touch several owned resources in one run (transfer a
 * call FROM one number TO another). ENDPOINT-ONLY — a provider cannot
 * default a binding (which endpoints touch resources is the least
 * provider-uniform fact there is).
 *
 *   - `provisions` (≤1, compile-checked): a success PROVISIONS — `seed`
 *     maps the settled envelope to the persisted record. ONE per
 *     endpoint: a run that could provision two things is two endpoints.
 *   - `uses`:     the run consumes an owned resource (places a call FROM
 *     your number): ownership-gated via `key`; marks the resource for
 *     usage reconcile at settle.
 *   - `updates`:  mutates upstream resource state (connect/disconnect):
 *     ownership-gated; marks it for refresh at settle.
 *   - `releases`: tears down: ownership-gated; a success marks the
 *     instance released (billing stops host-side).
 *   - `reads`:    read-only against an owned resource: ownership-gated,
 *     no settle marks.
 *
 * GATE ORDER is canonical: uses → updates → releases → reads,
 * declaration order within each purpose. Every KEYED binding's gated
 * instance rides into the lifecycle fns as `data.resources[alias]`
 * (`as` names the alias; default = the key path's last segment) — pure
 * hooks stay input-only.
