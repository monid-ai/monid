 * `connectors/<provider>/resources/<slug>/resource.ts`; id
 * `<provider>/<slug>`.
 *
 * The def declares WHAT the resource is (`data`), its RATE CARD
 * (`usage` — pure data; this repo reports, the broker prices, the host
 * charges), how estimated lines SYNC (`reconcileUsage`), its lifecycle
 * (`lifecycle.verify/release/refresh` — platform-driven, no user input),
 * its live reads (`views`) and its event streams (`webhooks`). What
 * USERS do to it is ordinary ENDPOINTS, bound via `resources:` blocks.
 *
 * No auth/request/timeouts sections: resources always run under their
 * provider's fused identity (compiler copies the provider's resolved
 * auth + origin + requestMs into the doc).
