 * narrows on top of the SAME declarations, so a doc's own fns are checked
 * against the doc's own model and input schema at `deno task check`:
 *
 *   - `usage.counts` KEYS are the model's literal metered keys — a typo'd
 *     or flat-component key fails the typecheck;
 *   - `data.input.body` is `z.output` of the doc's OWN input schema —
 *     direct property access, no JSONPath guessing (sound at runtime:
 *     `validateInput` runs the same schema before any hook, with schema
 *     defaults materialized into the body);
 *   - a COUNTING estimate cannot be declared on a flat doc at all (the
 *     slot type is `never` — "this preset doesn't support this model" is
 *     a doc-site type error, not a silent {} fallback).
